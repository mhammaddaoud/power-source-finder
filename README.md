# Power-Source-Finder
a very simple way to know what power source is powering the house

Using NodeMCU, 2 x 5v wall adapters (phone chargers) and a resistor voltage divider.  
Since the NodeMCU operates at 3.3v and the chargers outputs 5v, a voltage divider is made using 500 Ohm and 1K Ohm resistors.  

A basic Website is created on the NodeMCU to display the current power source via WIFI.
